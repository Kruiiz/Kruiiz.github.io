      <h3>The Insta-fluencer, HTML, CSS, P5JS, Photoshop, 2019</h3>
      <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/krystal.ruiz@sjsu.edu/present/RhVeoniZl">Enter</a>
      <p>The Insta-fluencer concept is a figure that showcases how social media sites like instagram and the popularization of photoshop/facetune warp our perception of what normal human bodies/proportions look like and how the negative
        impact it has on the minds of the younger generations is comparable to brainwashing.</p>

        <h3>Insta-fluenced, HTML, CSS, P5JS, Photoshop, 2019</h3>
        <a href="https://kruiiz.github.io/Insta-fluenced/">Enter</a>
        <p>A series continuation of The Insta-fluencer, this website exists to bring attention to the impact of what statistics consider to be the worst social media site for mental health. I wish to encourage more honest discussion about the negative influence
          Instagram has on both my generation and the younger generation. I wanted to showcase its tendency to encourage mental, emotional, and even financial dependency on the approval of strangers through likes and followers. Because of this, the amount
          of likes and followers one has are equated to not only brand value but one's personal value. With its growing popularity and media influence during an age of female empowerment and body positivity, society has slowly become conditioned to develop
          warped/unattainable beauty standards made worse by the glorification of tools and apps like Photoshop, Facetune, etc.</p>

        <h3>Cultural Conflict, Photoshop, 2019</h3>
        <p>Messages of body positivity and acceptance of different types of beauty among women are overshadowed by a growing desensitization of influencers and celebrities digitally manipulating the way they look in order to reach
        a beauty standard popularized by Instagram that is unattainable by any other means.</p>

        <h3>Validate Me, Photoshop, 2019</h3>
        <p>Getting validation or approval in the form of likes is an addictive cycle. Likes are the currency of my generation propagated by big companies who sponsor influencers to more easily manipulate potential consumers from their follower lists.</p>

          <h3> Negative Utopia, HTML and CSS, 2019</h3>
          <p>The concept is internet dystopia masquerading as a utopia (the internet provides many benefits that simultaneously hinder us in many other aspects).
            The website's purpose is to express our interpretation/prediction of the impact that the progression of the internet will have on society.</p>
