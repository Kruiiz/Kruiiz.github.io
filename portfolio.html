     <h3>Insta-fluenced, HTML, CSS, P5JS, Photoshop, 2020</h3>
        <p>A series continuation of a previous series called Insta-fluenced, this website exists to bring attention to the impact of what statistics consider to be the worst social media site for mental health. I wish to encourage more honest discussion about the negative influence
          Instagram has on both my generation and the younger generation. I wanted to showcase its tendency to encourage mental, emotional, and even financial dependency on the approval of strangers through likes and followers. Because of this, the amount
          of likes and followers one has are equated to not only brand value but one's personal value. With its growing popularity and media influence during an age of female empowerment and body positivity, society has slowly become conditioned to develop
          warped/unattainable beauty standards made worse by the glorification of tools and apps like Photoshop, Facetune, etc.</p>
