        <h3>"Dad and Me", Video, 2019</h3>
        <p>A day in the life of a young girl with a close but questionable relationship with her father/father figure. </p>

      <h3>I Dream in Pink, Photoshop, 2019</h3>
      <p>Used air balloons going over the mountain tops/road to represent a personal journey toward a healthier version of one's self.
        My idea was based on the concept of taking time to pamper yourself and reflect on your journey in life by retreating into nature in peaceful, dreamy solitude.</p>

        <h3>The Twins, Photoshop, 2019</h3>
        <p>For the first alternative version of my group piece CNK_Cyborg, I chose to use edit using photoshop in combination with notepad. I didn't really have an exact
          concept in mind but I was hoping to duplicate certain portions of the figure toward the bottom over and over until its "legs" were just made up of a copy of the part where its hips and thighs meet.
          The design of the third version was probably the most intentional. I wanted to combine the techniques and concept I had used in the first two to create a piece
          inspired by the imagery of the tarot card that represents the zodiac sign, gemini. I also wanted to make it a little more obvious by using the mirror tool to represent twins or the dual nature of the sign itself.</p>

          <h3> Negative Utopia, HTML and CSS, 2019</h3>
          <p>The concept is internet dystopia masquerading as a utopia (the internet provides many benefits that simultaneously hinder us in many other aspects).
            The website's purpose is to express our interpretation/prediction of the impact that the progression of the internet will have on society.</p>

          <p>I used three sounds inspired by a few of my everyday mild anxiety triggers.</p>
