    <a href="index.html"><h1>Artist Statement</h1></a>
    <p>Art has always played an integral role in my life as I’ve learned through the process of creating, the power of introspection and 
      self-reflection. At the moment, I’ve been working in both traditional and digital media in an effort to portray moments of emotional
      vulnerability and life’s complexities as I’ve found that in my life, embracing hard to swallow topics is sometimes the best way to 
      heal and grow. Therefore, my goal when creating art is to ultimately connect and inform those that view it by normalizing the presence 
      of intense and often private, but very human emotional experiences. </p>
<p>In contrast, my style of work is most often expressed using lighthearted, delicate, feminine, and somewhat sensual imagery as I feel
  that showcasing more playful, feminine figures and elements when discussing darker or more serious subject matter makes it more 
  approachable. Many of my themes take inspiration from both Japanese and western cartoons I watched during my childhood. In addition, I
  tend to use softer, pastel color palettes and seek to use this contrasting imagery and subject matter to subvert
  viewer expectations so that they might question and consider what emotions might lie beneath a person’s calm facade. </p>
<p>As I continue to refine my skills and grow as an artist, I wish to invite the viewer to explore deeper, darker emotions and 
  circumstances that we might often feel we have limited emotional tools to circumvent. I intend to encourage an emphasis on mental
  health awareness and open discussion of social-political issues involving sexuality, race, gender and gender identity.
