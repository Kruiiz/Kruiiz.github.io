    <a href="index.html"><h1>Artist Statement</h1></a>
    <p>Art has always played an integral role in my life as it is a passion that has fulfilled me in ways my personal relationships and circumstances have never been able to. Growing up as a rather sensitive and introverted child, I had difficulty in feeling comfortable in a world that didn’t seem to be made for people like me. Rarely did I feel welcomed or safe in making my presence and my thoughts known to most people in fear of being misunderstood. However, my interest in art almost seemed innate and so naturally, my passion to create became the language through which I would interact with not only the world but even with myself. I’ve learned through the process of creating, the power of introspection and self-reflection. Art gives me a platform for which to express my constant flurry of emotions and after all this time, I feel that I’m finally able to process my life’s circumstances, to better understand my own values, and to truly get a sense of my place within the world. </p>
<p>At the moment, I’ve been working in both traditional and digital media in an effort to portray moments of emotional vulnerability and life’s complexities. Art is often a deeply personal experience to me. In fact, so many of my works have been inspired by my own personal relationships and traumas while growing up and those of my family and friends. I’ve found that in my life, embracing hard to swallow topics like the acts and effects of suicide, rape, incest, and the many faces of mental and emotional abuse is sometimes the best way to heal and grow. You cannot change what you do not acknowledge. Therefore, my goal when creating art is to ultimately connect and inform those that view it by normalizing the presence of intense and often private, but very human emotional experiences. </p>
<p>In contrast, my style of work is most often expressed using lighthearted, delicate, feminine, and somewhat sensual imagery as I feel that showcasing more playful, feminine figures and elements when discussing darker or more serious subject matter makes it more approachable. Many of my themes take inspiration from both Japanese and western cartoons I watched during my childhood. In addition, I tend to use softer, pastel color palettes and seek to use this contrasting imagery and subject matter to disturb and disrupt the expectations of the viewers so that they might question and consider what emotions might lie beneath a person’s calm facade. </p>
<p>As I continue to refine my skills and grow as an artist, I wish to invite the viewer to explore deeper, darker emotions and circumstances that we might often feel we have limited emotional tools to circumvent. I intend to encourage an emphasis on mental health awareness and open discussion of social-political issues involving sexuality, race, gender and gender identity.
