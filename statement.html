    <p>I work in both traditional and digital media such as photography,
      acrylic paint, photoshop, and illustrator in an effort to portray life’s
      happiness and complexities.
      Many of my paintings have been inspired by my own personal relationships and
       traumas while growing up and those of my family and friends—embracing
       hard to swallow topics like the acts and effects of suicide, rape,
       incest, and the many faces of mental and emotional abuse. In contrast,
       the art style of many of my works is more lighthearted and sometimes takes
       inspiration from both japanese and western cartoons.
       In addition, I tend to use a softer and likely pastel color palettes
       in my paintings and digital works.  </p>
    <p>I seek to use the contrast between playful, feminine imagery and dark
      subject matter to disturb and disrupt the expectations of the viewers so
      that they might question and consider what emotions might lie beneath a
      person’s calm facade. As a highly sensitive and emotional person who grew
      up in an abusive environment that shamed me into hiding my innermost
      feelings, through my work, I wish to connect and inform people by
      normalizing the presence of intense and often private emotional
      experiences. I invite the viewer to explore deeper, darker emotions
      society often forces us to suppress within our daily lives. </p>
      <p>I’ve also dabbled in collage with themes placing more of an
        emphasis on mental health awareness and open discussion of
        social-political issues involving gender, sexuality, and race. </p>
